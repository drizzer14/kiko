# PFF quality harness

This project uses a Biome-adapted, LLM-guarding quality harness. Every
check runs through a wrapper in `scripts/checks/` that prints a
structured failure block on failure and stays silent on success.

**Standing rule: fix the underlying issue. Never weaken a check to get
green.** No `|| true`. No global auto-suppress. An ignore-list entry
needs a concrete, specific justification (see "Documented exceptions"
below).

## Checks

| Command | Tool | Threshold | Tier |
|---|---|---|---|
| `npm run check:lint` | Biome | any lint/format violation fails | fast (PostToolUse) |
| `npm run check:dup` | jscpd | >5% duplicated lines/tokens fails | medium (Stop/SubagentStop) |
| `npm run check:knip` | Knip | any unused file/export/dependency fails | medium |
| `npm run check:deps` | depcheck + `npm ci --dry-run` | any unused/missing dep, or broken lockfile, fails; a changed dependency block is surfaced for confirmation | medium |
| `npm run check:security` | Semgrep (`p/typescript`, `p/react`, `p/secrets`, `rules/semgrep-mobile.yml`) | any Class A (ERROR) finding fails; Class B (WARNING) findings are surfaced, override-eligible, non-blocking | fast |
| `npm run check:secrets` | gitleaks | any detected secret fails | fast |
| `npm run check:overrides` | override-guard.sh | any bare `biome-ignore` (no `OVERRIDE(...)`) fails | medium |
| `npm run check:mutation` | Stryker (Jest runner) | mutation score below 60 (break threshold; ratchet up over time) fails | deep only |
| `bash scripts/checks/osv.sh` | osv-scanner | any known CVE in `package-lock.json` fails | deep only |

Composite scripts:

- `npm run check:all` — the fast + medium tier checks, in order:
  lint, dup, knip, deps, security, secrets, overrides.
- `npm run check:deep` — the heavy tier: mutation testing, then
  osv-scanner. **Run this before declaring a feature done.** It is not
  wired to any hook because it is slow; it is a manual checkpoint.

Automatic wiring (`.claude/settings.json`): the fast tier
(`scripts/checks/fast.sh`: lint, security, secrets on the touched
file) runs on `PostToolUse` for `Edit|Write|MultiEdit`. The medium
tier (`scripts/checks/medium.sh`: dup, knip, deps, overrides) runs on
`Stop` and `SubagentStop`. Both wrappers exit `2` on failure and print
the structured block to stderr, which is how Claude Code surfaces the
failure back to the agent.

## Override protocol

A Biome lint rule may only be suppressed with a justified override —
never a bare `biome-ignore`:

```ts
// biome-ignore lint/suspicious/noExplicitAny: OVERRIDE(third-party boundary) the vendor SDK returns an untyped payload here
const raw: any = sdk.rawResponse();
```

`npm run check:overrides` fails on any `biome-ignore` comment that
does not contain `OVERRIDE(...)`. Do not delete the guard or move a
suppressed pattern elsewhere to dodge it — either justify the
override with a specific reason, or fix the code so the ignore is not
needed at all.

The same principle applies to every other ignore-list style
exception in this repo (see "Documented exceptions" below): a
suppression is only acceptable when it names a concrete reason a
human or agent can verify.

## Documented exceptions

Some tools cannot see how a dependency is actually used and would
otherwise report a false positive. Each exception below is a real,
verified usage, not dead weight:

- **`knip.json` `ignoreDependencies`**: `@babel/runtime` (injected by
  `@babel/plugin-transform-runtime` as helper imports in compiled
  output, never a static import), `@typescript/native-preview` (the
  `tsgo` / TS7 binary, reserved for a future typecheck script that
  does not exist yet), `jscpd`, `knip`, and `depcheck` (each invoked
  only via `npx --no-install <tool>` inside its own
  `scripts/checks/*.sh` wrapper, never from a package.json script
  Knip's static scan can see).
- **`.depcheckrc.json` `ignores`**: the same CLI-only-invoked tools
  (`jscpd`, `knip`, `depcheck`) plus `@babel/runtime`,
  `@react-native-community/cli` and `-cli-platform-ios` (invoked by
  the `react-native` CLI, not imported), `@stryker-mutator/core` /
  `-jest-runner` (used via `stryker.conf.json` + npx), `@types/jest`
  (type-only), and `typescript` (provides `tsc`/type declarations for
  the toolchain, not directly invoked in a script).
- **`.gitleaks.toml` allowlist**: `ios/Podfile.lock` — CocoaPods lists
  a SHA1 checksum per pod, which gitleaks' `generic-api-key` rule
  flags as a false positive (verified fingerprint:
  `ios/Podfile.lock:generic-api-key:1966`).
- **`.npmrc` `min-release-age-exclude`**: `PFF`, the first-party
  package name, is exempt from the dependency min-age rule below.

## Dependency hygiene

`.npmrc` enforces a 7-day dependency minimum age:

```
min-release-age=7
min-release-age-exclude[]=PFF
```

Note for anyone editing this: the real npm 11 config keys are
`min-release-age` (a plain number of **days**) and
`min-release-age-exclude`. `minimum-release-age` /
`minimum-release-age-exclude[]` are **not** recognized keys — npm
silently warns "Unknown project config" and enforces nothing. This
was verified against the npm CLI's own config definitions and by
testing: a version published 2 days ago was blocked; a years-old
version installed normally.

This requires npm 11.10+. Global npm on this machine was upgraded
(user-approved) from 10.9.3 to 11.19.1 to enable it.

`check:deep`'s osv-scanner step previously failed on 6 known CVEs in
transitive dev dependencies pulled in by the React Native CLI
toolchain (`@babel/core`, `ajv`, `image-size`, `tmp`). Four had a
patched version available and are now remediated via the
`overrides` block in `package.json` (`@babel/core`, `ajv`, `tmp`);
two (in `image-size`) do not yet — see "Known dependency CVEs"
below. This is tracked, real risk, not a harness bug — do not
suppress it.

### Known dependency CVEs

`check:deep` will continue to flag 2 `image-size` advisories
(GHSA-5p2g-fcmc-qvqq, GHSA-w3rx-r6r6-pgpr) at version 1.2.1, a
transitive dev dependency of the React Native CLI toolchain. No
patched release exists upstream yet, so there is nothing to pin via
`overrides`. This is accepted debt, not a suppressed finding — do
not silence it. Re-run `npm run check:deep` periodically and upgrade
`image-size` (via `overrides`) the moment a fixed version ships.

## Future stubs (disabled — do not enable without discussion)

```bash
# FUTURE (disabled): a pre-commit hook could run `npm run check:all`.
# FUTURE (disabled): a CI job could run `npm run check:all` and `npm run check:deep` as required checks.
```
